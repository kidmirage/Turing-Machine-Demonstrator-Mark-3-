# Turing-Machine-Demonstrator-Mark-3-
A Turing machine application written in Python with an optional funky tile based interface.

Just the software so far. 

You should be able to run the Tmd3Console.py file found in he Console folder on any machine with Python3. As far as I know the only dependenvcy is PyGame.

For details check out the TMD-3 Quick Start Guide in the Manual folder.
